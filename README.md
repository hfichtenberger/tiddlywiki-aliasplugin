# General Information

This is a plugin for TiddlyWiki 5. It provides a macro *alias* to link tiddlers
by an alternative identifier called *alias* instead of its title. One or
multiple aliases can be entered as a custom field *alias* of a tiddler.

# Files in This Repository
The contents of this repository can be copied to a TiddlyWiki 5 root directory.
It is then possible to build a wrapper wiki by running

    node ./tiddlywiki.js editions/aliaspackage --build index

on a terminal. The wrapper wiki will be saved to `editions/aliaswrapper/output`.
